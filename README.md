## Preamble

### Open question to the community

The question is open to the entire community of software developers, the scientific community, innovators, knowledge generators, content generators, entrepreneurs, governments, legislators, politicians and all those who believe that the use of artificial intelligence should be regulated or who, at least, want the use of their creations to have a positive effect on society.
